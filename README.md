### Hey there 👋

💬 Im Lionel, a self-taught, ambitious & pragmatical developer. 
I've been on the industry ~2 years working, primarily, on Frontend, but I'm around soft & hardware since I was a kid.

🐃 Im enthusiastic about the GNU/Linux ecosystem and the FOSS principles. All my personal projects are Open Source and available here, with proper documentation (I love writing it).

🔭 Im looking forwards to learn more about how a big, modern, complex and scalable code base should be architectured, in order to better translate business requirements into technical requirements.

😄 I really enjoy sharing my humble knowledge to fellow developers, and mentoring whenever I can the ones who are just initiating their career.
